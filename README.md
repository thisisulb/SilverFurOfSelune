## Silver Fur of Selûne v1.2
### for BG2: SoA / ToB / BGT / TuTu

This kit mod offers the possibility to play as a priest/werewolf.
Originally this kit was intended to be part of a bigger mod pack, containing other character kits as
well as game improvements, all centered around lycanthropy.
Therefore, this kit might in time become part of a bigger mod, called the Lycanthropy Pack.

**Overview**   
Available languages: // English // German //  
The Silver Fur Kit will be available to every race with access to the priest class.  
The character will be limited to studded leather armor. At level 1 she will gain the ability to
shapeshift into werewolf form, which will scale up as the character's level advances.  
For a full kit description (including in-game 'flavor' text) please visit the mod forum.  
  
**Requirements:**  
BG2 including ToB with the latest official patch.  
I also would strongly suggest to install the latest version of TobEx. Without TobEx, the werewolf
form can be dispelled by 'dispel magic'.  
  
**Compatibility:**  
The Silver Fur of Selûne Kit is compatible with Divine Remix, and can therefore be installed before
or after.  
Other than that, the mod should be (as in: I really hope it is ) compatible with pretty much any
other WeiDU mod out there.  
(If you run into any compatibility issues, please contact me via the Spellhold Studios.)  
  
**Installation:**  
I. Extract the 'SilverFur_V1.2.7z' file into your BG2 main folder and make sure that both, the
'Setup-SilverFur.exe' and the 'SilverFur' folder, are indeed in your BG2 main folder.  
II. Run (double click on) "Setup-SilverFur.exe".  
III. Follow the on-screen instructions.  
  
**Known Bugs:**  
If a Silver Fur of Selûne is under the effect of a casting speed penalty, her shapeshift spell won't be
an instant cast and could therefore be interrupted. If that happens, she might not properly shapeshift
into her alternate form, but still receive the corresponding spell (natural form or werewolf).  
In that case, just cast the spell and things should go back to normal again.
